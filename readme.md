# Instructions
## config.yaml
Rename `config_template.yaml` to `config.yaml`

### config.yaml: trello fields
1) Make sure you are logged into a [Trello](https://trello.com) account with access to the board you want
2) Generate a [Trello API key](https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate)
3) There will be two keys on the page once you generate the keys. The block below describes which goes where.
4) A third key (token) will be generated by clicking **Generate a Token**, below **Personal Key**

The following table describe which key goes where:
| config.yaml field | Corresponding key/token |
| -                 | -                       |
| API_key           | Personal key            |
| API_secret        | OAuth Secret            |
| Token             | Token                   |

### config.yaml: google fields
Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com)
For each calendar you want to add, do the following:
1) Click the three dots by the calendar in the sidebar, then open Settings
2) Scroll down to **Integrate calendar** and copy the Calendar ID
3) Add a new field to config.yaml under google, and paste your calendar ID after it (e.g. `calendarID1: 'lsdkghqwruhg@group.calendar.google.com'`)

### config.yaml: path
Copy the directory name of the folder containing all the files into the field
